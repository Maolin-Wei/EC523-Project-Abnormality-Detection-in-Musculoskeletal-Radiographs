## Introduction
Our task is to develop an automated abnormality detection system for musculoskeletal radiographs, similar to the system described in the referenced paper. The system will analyze radiographs to identify fractures, lesions, or joint abnormalities. One of the main challenges of this task is accurately identifying subtle abnormalities within complex anatomical structures while accounting for variations in imaging conditions and patient anatomy.
